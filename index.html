			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p class="p2">My name is Andrew. I was born, raised, and educated in Massachusetts. I currently work at a medical software company called Meditech as a Senior Application Specialist. I am a huge Godzilla fan and collector. I have been able to share this hobby with the local community by hosting exhibitions of my collection and artwork as well as setting up family events including story time for kids, video game tournaments, and movie showings. </p>
			<p class="p2">I have always been interested in web design and development since middle school. I have experience with HTML, XML, CSS, and recently completed a course in Web Content Management Systems (CMS) systems which went over Wordpress, Moodle, and Joomla to name a few. </p>
			<p class="p2"> I am taking this class CSCIE-15 to take my web development knowledge to the next level as well as working towards completing the Harvard Extension Information Technology Masters Degree with the concentration in Information Management Systems. </p>
			<p class="p2">I have experience with various Adobe products including Dreamweaver, Premiere, Sound booth, as well as Microsoft Front Page, and was the winner of Microsoft's Web Developer 2005 beta contest prior during my senior year at UMass Amherst. I was awarded a 3 day job shadow at E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) in Los Angeles. I have created setup guides for my group's product resource homepage as well as the Art Liaison's event page for the Creature Double Feature event at my company. </p>
			<p class="p2">My personal Godzilla webpage (now located at <a href="https://www.gforever.net" target="_new">gforever.net</a>) started in 1996 has grown through various stages. The current version focuses on news, reviews, and an open forum. While I don't have much experience with Flash, I did take a course in 3D modeling and animation with AutoDesk Maya. I also created a web catalog for my uncle's furniture company but he forgot to renew his web hosting account and it got wiped out. Luckily the internet has an archive so it has been preserved on the way back machine located in the archive links. </p>
			<p class="p2">Since I'm working full time and going to grad school part time, I don't have much time to work on his websites. When time allows, I'll take the opportunity to revamp the websites with the new knowledge I've gained. </p>
